This is from a react course I found online, it is an attempt at a Netflix-Clone. It uses React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

There are two API's being used, one from The Movie Database (TMDB) and Youtube to fetch trailers.
The API I am using to connect to youtube trailers does not work on the 'Netflix Originals' category, but it works on all others. After opening a trailer, click the same image to close it.
